Report
As a marketing expert for a leading PC manufacturer and supplier, our company analyses customer reviews on Amazon to get insights on product performance and customer expectations. The study is conducted on the dataset with PC as a word and preceding adjective to determine the strength of the reviews. 
Below are the results and steps to arrive at the output.
1.	From the dataset, we have 13153 reviews.
2.	The wordcloud is generated but it includes all the stopwords. Stopwords are weak words that do not add value to the review, eg conjunctions, prepositions, and articles.
3.	Removed the stopwords and generate a new wordcloud.
4.	Use spacy for tokenization of the dataset. 
5.	Next, lemmatization is run on the dataset for identification of meaning and part of speech of the word as it is listed in a dictionary.
6.	Further, stemming is run to reduce the words to the root form or stem form. This process increases the accuracy of including a word that is used in different contexts.
7.	With spacy, deeper insights into the data set are obtained.
8.	From the results, we find instances of ‘PC’, preceded by an adjective. The marketing strategy can use keywords to create an impact in the minds of customers by addressing customer expectations. Data-driven marketing is a scientific method of strategizing the market place and gives the company a competitive advantage in the market.
